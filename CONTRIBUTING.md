Thank you for considering contributing to FosterFlow Hub. This document outlines the guidelines and best practices for development.

## Development Rules

### UI Development
1. **Keep React Components Small**: 
   - Maximum 100 lines per component
   - Extract functionality into smaller components when necessary
   - Use composition to build complex interfaces

2. **Use Tailwind CSS**:
   - Follow the project's design system
   - Utilize Tailwind utility classes for styling
   - Avoid custom CSS unless absolutely necessary

### Backend Development
1. **Code Comments**:
   - Comment all backend code with reasoning
   - Explain "why" not just "what" the code does
   - Document any non-obvious implementation decisions

2. **UI Monitoring**:
   - Continuously monitor UI for backend requirements
   - Update backend as UI needs evolve
   - Maintain alignment between frontend and backend capabilities

### Workflow
1. **Task Focus**:
   - Limit to one task per message
   - Complete current task before moving to next one
   - Break complex features into smaller, manageable tasks

2. **Prompt-Based Development**:
   - Use yes/no prompts for backend needs
   - Suggest appropriate tests for new features
   - Recommend security considerations
   - Suggest deployment options when relevant

3. **Conversation Hygiene**:
   - Start fresh conversations weekly
   - Reset context to maintain development clarity
   - Reference previous work as needed but prefer clean slates
